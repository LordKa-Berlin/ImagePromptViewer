## 🔍 What is ImagePromptViewer?

**ImagePromptViewer** is a lightweight, powerful image viewer tailored for AI-generated images that contain embedded **prompt metadata**.  
Its core purpose is to **extract and display the full prompt structure** used during image generation — including the **Prompt**, **Negative Prompt**, and **Generation Settings** — directly from PNG and JPEG files.

It supports images generated by tools such as **Forge**, **ComfyUI**, **InvokeAI**, **Fooocus**, **DiffusionBee**, **AUTOMATIC1111**, and others.

Whether you're curating datasets, analyzing generation details, or exploring how images were created —  
**ImagePromptViewer helps you uncover the embedded intelligence behind every AI image.**

**sorry for the exuberant text, it was created by an AI 😄**
