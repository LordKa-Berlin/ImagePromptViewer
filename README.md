# ImagePromptViewer

**Version:** 1.0.36.3a  
**Codename:** Master8 Alpha5  
**License:** [CC BY-NC 4.0](LICENSE)

## Description

**ImagePromptViewer** is an advanced image viewer for `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` files. It extracts and displays embedded prompt data (such as *prompt*, *negative prompt*, and *generation settings*) from Stable Diffusion outputs.

It supports both:
- PNG text chunks (e.g., `info['parameters']`)
- JPEG EXIF tags (`UserComment`, tag `37510`)

The program displays the extracted data in structured fields, and allows filtering, copying, and navigation through folders containing images.
